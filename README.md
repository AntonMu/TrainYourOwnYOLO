# TrainYourOwnYOLO: Building a Custom Object Detector from Scratch [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](LICENSE)

This repo let's you train a custom image detector using the state-of-the-art [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) computer vision algorithm. For a short write up check out this [medium post](https://medium.com/@muehle/how-to-train-your-own-yolov3-detector-from-scratch-224d10e55de2). 

### Pipeline Overview

To build and test your object detection algorithm follow the below steps:

 1. [Image Annotation](/1_Image_Annotation/)
	 - Install Microsoft's Visual Object Tagging Tool (VoTT)
	 - Annotate images
 2. [Training](/2_Training/)
 	- Download pre-trained weights
 	- Train your custom YOLO model on annotated images 
 3. [Inference](/3_Inference/)
 	- Detect objects in new images and videos

## Repo structure
+ [`1_Image_Annotation`](/1_Image_Annotation/): Scripts and instructions on annotating images
+ [`2_Training`](/2_Training/): Scripts and instructions on training your YOLOv3 model
+ [`3_Inference`](/3_Inference/): Scripts and instructions on testing your trained YOLO model on new images and videos
+ [`Data`](/Data/): Input Data, Output Data, Model Weights and Results
+ [`Utils`](/Utils/): Utility scripts used by main scripts

## Getting Started

### Requisites
The only hard requirement is a running version of python 3.3 or newer. To install the latest python 3.x version go to 
- [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

and follow the installation instructions. 

To speed up training, it is recommended to use a **GPU with CUDA** support. For example on [AWS](/2_Training/AWS/) you can use a `p2.xlarge` instance (Tesla K80 GPU with 12GB memory). Inference is very fast even on a CPU with approximately ~2 images per second. 


### Installation

#### Setting up Virtual Environment [Linux or Mac]

Clone this repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO
cd TrainYourOwnYOLO/
```
Create Virtual **(Linux/Mac)** Environment (requires [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) which is included in the standard library of Python 3.3 or newer):
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
Make sure that, from now on, you **run all commands from within your virtual environment**.

#### Setting up Virtual Environment [Windows]
Use the [Github Desktop GUI](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone this repo to your local machine. Navigate to the `TrainYourOwnYOLO` project folder and open a power shell window by pressing **Shift + Right Click** and selecting `Open PowerShell window here` in the drop-down menu.

Create Virtual **(Windows)** Environment (requires [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) which is included in the standard library of Python 3.3 or newer):

```
py -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
![PowerShell](/Utils/Screenshots/PowerShell.png)
Make sure that, from now on, you **run all commands from within your virtual environment**.

#### Install Required Packages [Windows, Mac or Linux]
If you are running TrainYourOwnYOLO on a machine with **GPU with CUDA** drivers installed run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements_gpu.txt
```
Otherwise, run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements_cpu.txt
```

## Quick Start (Inference only)
To test the cat face detector on test images located in [`TrainYourOwnYOLO/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images) run the `Minimal_Example.py` script in the root folder with:

```
python Minimal_Example.py
```

The outputs are saved in [`TrainYourOwnYOLO/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results). This includes:
 - Cat pictures with bounding boxes around faces with confidence scores and
 - [`Detection_Results.csv`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results/Detection_Results.csv) file with file names and locations of bounding boxes.

 If you want to detect cat faces in your own pictures, replace the cat images in [`Data/Source_Images/Test_Images`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images) with your own images.

## Full Start (Training and Inference)

To train your own custom YOLO object detector please follow the instructions detailed in the three numbered subfolders of this repo:
- [`1_Image_Annotation`](/1_Image_Annotation/),
- [`2_Training`](/2_Training/) and
- [`3_Inference`](/3_Inference/).
 
**To make everything run smoothly it is highly recommended to keep the original folder structure of this repo!**

Each `*.py` script has various command line options that help tweak performance and change things such as input and output directories. All scripts are initialized with good default values that help accomplish all tasks as long as the original folder structure is preserved. To learn more about available command line options of a python script `<script_name.py>` run:

```
python <script_name.py> -h
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If you are using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) and are having trouble running `python3 -m venv env`, try:
    ```
    pipenv shell
    ```

2. If you are having trouble getting cv2 to run, try:

    ```
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

3. If you are a Linux user and having trouble installing `*.snap` package files try:
    ```
    snap install --dangerous vott-2.1.0-linux.snap
    ```
