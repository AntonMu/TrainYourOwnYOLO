# Contributing to TrainYourOwnYOLO

Contributions are highly appreciated. If you'd like to make a contribution, please:

 1. Fork the repo and make all changes on your own fork. 

 1. Once you are happy with your new feature do the following:

    * Apply [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting  

    * Make sure you have as few commits as possible. For a small feature, there should only be a single commit.

    * Rebase off the upstream/master branch to avoid merge conflicts.

    * Test your feature on all three major operating systems (Windows, Linux and macOS) with and without using a GPU. Thus, you need to run tests in at least 6 different environments. 

 1. Create a pull request to the upstream/master branch. The pull request must include:

    * A description of the new feature,
    
    * A minimal test example that uses the new feature,
    
    * A list of tested system configurations (OS and GPU model).

 1. Once the PR is created, wait for feedback and incorporate suggested changes. 

 1. That's it!
    * Once the PR is merged, you are an official contributor of TrainYourOwnYOLO. 🎉🥳
